# tic-tac-toe
The goal of this project was to create a tic-tac-toe game that could be played against a friend or the computer. For playing against the computer, I created three different difficulty levels:
* Easy: the computer plays randomly on an available square. 
* Hard: the computer will complete its own three-in-a-row if possible. If that is not possible, the computer will try to block the player if the player has a two-in-a-row. Otherwise, the computer will play randomy. 
* Impossible: the computer cannot be beaten.
